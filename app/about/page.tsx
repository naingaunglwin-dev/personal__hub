            I'm a passionate developer with experience in PHP and web development, currently working in a Japan-based company, <strong>Aluto-Benli</strong> as a remote developer. I initiated my journey into web development in 2021. I completed a three-month web development fullstack course in April, 2022 and followed by On-Job-Training (OJT) in September, 2022. Currently, I am also developing my own PHP framework and exploring backend development while diving into new technologies. My experience includes working with CodeIgniter, Laravel, and learning Node.js and Next.js. I'm familiar with Git for version control and Composer for package management, with a strong interest in backend development and framework building. I also love writing open-source packages. I also want to learn software development and always curious and eager to explore new technologies.
